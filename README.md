# TheIronYard
## A repo containing the class and homework I did while attending The Iron Yard

### Concept
• I left my job at Apple to pursue a career in software development, and I chose to begin my learning at The Iron Yard, a programming bootcamp. This repo is full of in-class and homework projects I did while attending The Iron Yard for Mobile iOS Engineering. My work is divided between InClass and Homework directories, and projects denote whether they were done in Objective-C or Swift with the “OBJC” or “SWIFT” prefix, respectively.
